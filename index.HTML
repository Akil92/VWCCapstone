    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p class="p">Hello, my name is Akil Maynard. I have a Trinidadian background, but was born in Germany and moved a lot due to the military.
       I grew up mostly in Georgia and served in the Air Force for 4 years. Stationed in Eielson Air Force Base, I worked as 
       a Heavy Equipment Operator. After my time in the Air Force in Alaska, I continued construction for a little bit but then started to worked
       with computers and tech. This lead me on my journey where I began coding by completing a Software Engineer Bootcamp with General Assembly, which took place from June 2023 - Sept. 2023.
       I'm still in the early stages of coding but eager to learn more.</p>
